## Ag Innovation Challenges

### Challenge 1: Clean Grass Seed
> *"In this challenge, we would like to leverage technology to create an automated solution for spot spraying weeds to increase the yield of a grass seed per acre.  Assume it is a small grass farm with 6 fields and each one is 50 acres per field.  Potential technical solutions could include artificial 
intelligence, machine learning, mixed reality, robotics, drones, etc."*

### Challenge 2: Statewide Agriculture Data Hub
> *"In this challenge, we would like to leverage technology to create a data hub that can scale to host all Oregon crops information, run analytics on top of the data for trend spotting, etc. and determine a way to compensate growers for sharing data.  Potential technical solutions include big data tools such as Hadoop or MongoDB, machine learning, big data analytics tools such as Tableau Public, etc."*
