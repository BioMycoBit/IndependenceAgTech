## Ag Innovation Challenges

### Challenge 1: Clean Grass Seed
> *"In this challenge, we would like to leverage technology to create an automated solution for spot spraying weeds to increase the yield of a grass seed per acre.  Assume it is a small grass farm with 6 fields and each one is 50 acres per field.  Potential technical solutions could include artificial 
intelligence, machine learning, mixed reality, robotics, drones, etc."*

### Challenge 2: Statewide Agriculture Data Hub
> *"In this challenge, we would like to leverage technology to create a data hub that can scale to host all Oregon crops information, run analytics on top of the data for trend spotting, etc. and determine a way to compensate growers for sharing data.  Potential technical solutions include big data tools such as Hadoop or **MongoDB**, machine learning, big data analytics tools such as Tableau, etc."*

### Challenge 3: Agriculture Approval Process
> *"In this challenge, we would like to see workflow and process automation developed to lessen the time it takes for this approval process to occur and minimize mistakes.  Additionally, there is an opportunity to develop a system where a grower/producer can input the data once and share it in an authenticated way to various agencies.  Potential technical solutions could include distributed ledger technology such as **blockchain**, business process management, workflow management solutions, etc."*

#### Challenge 4: Goggles for enhanced wine production
> *"In this challenge, we would like to see goggles developed that could be worn by a crew on the conveyor line to more accurately remove rotten or unripened fruit.  Potential technical solutions include hardware and software with advanced algorithms incorporated to select the best fruit, more accurately drop fruit from the vines in the field rather than harvest, etc"*

#### Challenge 5: "What's that crop?" App
> *"In this challenge, we would like to see the development of an application that allows consumers to interact directly with growers to learn about farming practices, ask questions about crops with which they are not familiar and engage directly to ask questions in the event of a foodborne illness.  Potential solutions include a custom developed portal, two way marketplace, social engagement platform, etc.*
