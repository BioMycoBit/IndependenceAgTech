### Challenge 1: Clean Grass Seed
> *"In this challenge, we would like to leverage technology to create an automated solution for spot spraying weeds to increase the yield of a grass seed per acre.  Assume it is a small grass farm with 6 fields and each one is 50 acres per field.  Potential technical solutions could include artificial 
intelligence, machine learning, mixed reality, robotics, drones, etc."*
